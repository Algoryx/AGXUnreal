# A CMake toolchain is a configuration of a set of CMake variables that make
# CMake generate build files in a particular way. We can, for example, set the
# compiler to use, default compile and link flags, and which standard library to
# link against. A toolchain is selected by passing
# `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<path/to/toolchain.cmake>` the _first_ time the CMake
# project is configured.
#
# This particular toolchain tries to configure the toolchain so that binaries
# compatible with Unreal Engine is produced. The flags have been taken from
# https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/674473/compiling-libraries-in-linux.html
# where RCL, an Epic Games employee, describe how to build third-party libraries,
# and from the output of [ue4cli](https://docs.adamrehn.com/ue4cli/overview/introduction-to-ue4cli).

# We use the UE_ROOT environment variable to find the compiler and standard
# libraries to use. This variable must have been set before running CMake.
# Altenatively, it can be passed on the CMake command line as
#   -DUE_ROOT=<PATH_TO_UNREAL_ENGINE>

# For now this script contains a number of in-source configurations. The intent
# is that all of these will either be removed or made automatic. Search for
# 'CONFIGURATION POINT' to find them.



# Things that need to be configured:
#
# CMake flags
#
# The behavior of CMake can be controlled using various flags. This affects
# things like where CMake will search for files. By default it searches in the
# system directories, but we may want to have it search in the Unreal Engine
# compiler directory as well.
#
# Compiler
#
# Unreal Engine has been built with a particular version of Clang and we wish to
# match this. We can build either using a system installed Clang or the one in
# the Unreal Engine installation.
#
# Compiler flags
#
# The flags that are passed when source files are built. This includes things
# like include paths, preprocessor defines, and ... what else? We may want to
# add the include directory for the Clang installation in the Unreal Engine
# installation.
#
# Linker flags
#
# The flags that are passed when a build target is being linked. This includes
# things like dependency libraries and directories in which to search for them.
# We may want to add the `lib` directory for the Clang installation in the
# Unreal Engine installation.
#





# Disable implicit NO_POLICY_SCOPE.
#
# CMake used to have `cmake_policy` settings set in a sub-scripts propagate
# into the caller. CMake 3.10 warns on this, By setting this policy to NEW we
# enable policy scoping and the caller regain control over its own policies.
cmake_policy(SET CMP0011 NEW)



# Enable the 'IN_LIST' operator.
#
# I don't know why I need to explicitly specify this all of a sudden. I didn't
# before and IN_LIST has existed for ages, at least since CMake 3.3.
cmake_policy(SET CMP0057 NEW)



#
# Make sure we know which Unreal Engine installation to use.
#

# Fall back to environment variable if not set in or pass to CMake explicitly.

### CONFIGURATION POINTS
###


#
# CONFIGURATION POINT: Compiler.
#
# We can choose to either use the system compiler or the one shipped with Unreal
# Engine. When using the the Unreal Engine compiler one can also set sysroot.
#
# Different Ubuntu distributions have different versions of Clang, so set the
# proper binary name each time the system compiler is to be used.
#
# The long-term solution is to always use the compiler shipped with Unreal Engine.
#
# Pick one:
#set(CONFIG_COMPILER "UNREAL")
set(CONFIG_COMPILER "UNREAL_WITH_SYSROOT")
#set(CONFIG_COMPILER "SYSTEM")

# When CONFIG_COMPILER is set to 'SYSTEM', this is the compiler that will be used.

###
### The following configuration point, C++ project is not needed anymore since we
### now have two separate CMake configuration files. Any project that uses this
### file instead of the C version must be a C++ project.
###

#
# CONFIGURATION POINT: C++ project
#
# Because of a bug in CMake < 3.12 we need to know if we are about to configure
# a C++ project or a pure C project. Search for the configuration variable in
# this file to find a description of why.
#
# Pick one:
set(CONFIG_CXX_PROJECT "ON")
#set(CONFIG_CXX_PROJECT "OFF")
#
#set(CONFIG_OPTIONS_CXX_PROJECT "ON" "OFF")
#if(NOT "${CONFIG_CXX_PROJECT}" IN_LIST CONFIG_OPTIONS_CXX_PROJECT)
#  message(FATAL_ERROR "CONFIG_CXX_PROJECT must be one of ${CONFIG_OPTIONS_CXX_PROJECT}.")
#endif()


#
# CONFIGURATION POINT: Unreal Engine C system libraries to CMake.
#
# This informs CMake, using CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, of the C system libraries included
# with the Clang installation in the Unreal Engine installation, so that
# 'find_package' can find them. This is strongly related to sysroot and system
# libraries in linker search paths, I think, in that this part should be OFF
# when CONFIG_COMPILER is set to UNREAL_WITH_SYSROOT.
#
# I'm not sure if this should be ON or OFF when using a system Clang. Are these
# tightly coupled with a particular Clang version?
#
# The C system libraries are stored in various subdirectories of
#  ${UE_ROOT}/Engine/Extras/ThirdPartyNotUE/SDKs/HostLinux/Linux_x64/v16_clang-9.0.1-centos7/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/

#
# CONFIGURATION POINT: Include Unreal Engine C system libraries in linker search paths.
#
# Tell the linker to search for libraries in the Unreal Engine compiler
# directories. That's where we have 'm', 'c', 'rt', and such.
#
# This will enable the flags printed by `ue4 ldflags libc++`.
# I worry that this isn't quite true. The `ue4 ldflags` only print C++ standard
# libraries, not the C libraries. So I think those will still be picked up from
# the host system if only passing the ue4cli flags.
#
# I think this relates to sysroot and CONFIG_UE_C_LIBS_TO_CMAKE.

# Pick one:
