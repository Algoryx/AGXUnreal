/**
 * Defines material properties for contacts between AGX Shapes with specific AGX Materials. This
 * will override many of their individual material properties (does for example not override ones
 * effecting mass, such as density).
 *
 * ContactMaterials are created by the user in-Editor by creating a UAGX_ContactMaterialAsset.
 * In-Editor they are treated as assets and can be referenced by a Contact Material Registrar
 * Component.
 *
 * When game begins playing, one UAGX_ContactMaterialInstance will be created for each
 * UAGX_ContactMaterialAsset that is referenced by a Contact Material Registrar Component. The
 * UAGX_ContactMaterialInstance will create the actual native AGX ContactMaterial and add it to the
 * simulation. The in-game Contact Material Registrar Component that referenced the
 * UAGX_ContactMaterialAsset will swap its reference to the in-game created
 * UAGX_ContactMaterialInstance instead. This means that ultimately only
 * UAGX_ContactMaterialInstances will be referenced in-game. When play stops the in-Editor state
 * will be returned.
 *
 * Note that this means that UAGX_ContactMaterialAssets that are not referenced a Contact Material
 * Registrar Component will be inactive.
 *
 * Note also that it is not allowed to replace the Materials properties after instance has been
 * created.
